## ❤️ Preface

As early as around 10 years ago, when I was using the web version of QQ, I had already started using Kugou Music (which I have been a fan of for over ten years), so all the songs I collected over the years were on it Later on, I also tried using NetEase Cloud or QQ Music, and tried importing Kugou's playlists into it, but the results were not satisfactory I mostly listen to Japanese anime OP, and I can't find many songs

After wandering around, I finally returned to Kugou. However, on the Mac version of Kugou, there may often be situations where it cannot be played. Although the interface does not have many functions, it is still quite good With the support of netizens, I have been working on [Kugou's concept version](https://t1.kugou.com/d2tBza3CSV2)Listen to music online, and it is one of the few music playback software on the market that allows you to listen to VIP songs for free. It is highly recommended

I said on my personal introduction page that I particularly enjoy listening to music, especially Japanese anime OP How can we prove it? (My web version of the playlist was also in disrepair for a long time before) So I'll develop my own music player

```sh
npm run build:api:win
```
- Linux:
```sh
npm run build:api:linux
```
- macOS:
```sh
npm run build:api:macos
```

5. Choose the following command to package the appropriate installation package for you, and the packaged file should be located in the '/dits_electron' directory. For more information, please visit the [Electron Builder documentation](https://www.electron.build/cli )


#### 1.  Package macOS platform
- Universal macOS package (Intel and Apple Silicon dual architecture):
```
npm run electron:build -- --mac --universal
```
- Only Intel architecture:
```
npm run electron:build -- --mac --x64
```
- Only Apple Silicon architecture:
```
npm run electron:build -- --mac --arm64
```


#### 2.  Package Windows Platform

- Default NSIS installation package (suitable for most Windows users):
```
npm run electron:build -- --win
```
- Create EXE files and Squirrel installation packages for Windows:
```
npm run electron:build -- --win --ia32 --x64 --arm64 --target squirrel
```
  - Ia32 is a 32-bit Windows architecture.
  - X64 is a 64 bit Windows architecture.
  - Arm64 is based on ARM Windows architecture (for devices such as Surface).

- Generate portable EXE files for Windows (installation free):
```
npm run electron:build -- --win --portable
```
#### 3.  Packaging Linux Platform
- Default AppImage format (applicable to most Linux distributions):
```
npm run electron:build -- --linux
```
- Snap (for Ubuntu and Snap supported distributions):
```
npm run electron:build -- --linux --target snap
```
- Deb (applicable to the Debian/Ubuntu series):
```
npm run electron:build -- --linux --target deb
```
- RPM (applicable to Red Hat/Fedora series):
```
npm run electron:build -- --linux --target rpm
```
